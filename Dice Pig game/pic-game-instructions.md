## GAME RULES:
- The game has *2 players*, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, *if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost*. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The *player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score*. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The **first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game**

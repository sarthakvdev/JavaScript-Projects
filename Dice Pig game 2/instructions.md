## GAME RULES:

#### Basic Rules:
- The game has *2 players*, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result get added to his ROUND score
- BUT, *if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost*. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The *player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score*. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The **first player to reach default 100 or input Final score, wins the game**

#### New Changes from v1:
1. A player looses his ENTIRE score when he rolls two 6 in a row. After that, it's the next player's turn. *(This section is disabled right now)*
2. New input field is added at bottom where players can set the winning score, so that they can change the predefined score of 100.
3. Added second dice to the game, so that there are two dices now. The player looses his current score when one of them is a 1.

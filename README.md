#### Forkify - A Food Recipe Application:

- Forkify is a vanilla JavaScript application that interacts with the **food2fork API** to fetch and display recipe food data.

  This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as *Webpack* to bundle the modules, and *Babel* to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, and add ingredients to a shopping list or save to a favourites list via local storage.
